# About DjVu.js

DjVu.js is a program library for working with djvu online. It's written in
JavaScript and can be run in the web browsers without any connection with the
server. DjVu.js can be used for splitting djvu files, rendering pages of djvu
document, converting (and compressing) images into djvu documents and for
analyzing of metadata of djvu documents. Also, it can download and bundle 
indirect (multi-file) djvu document into one file. 

All source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RussCoder/djvujs)

In order to demonstrate the abilities of the library, I decided to create the
DjVu.js Viewer. The main idea is to create a plug-in that can be easily included
to any web page.

If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue
on [GitHub](https://github.com/RussCoder/djvujs/issues), or write me at the
email: `djvujs@yandex.ru`

If you have a djvu document that can't be rendered by the DjVu.js Viewer, please
send it to me. It's very important, since the djvu format is quite complicated,
and I didn't test all code of my library, since I just don't have appropriate
examples of djvu files.

And, of course, any contribution is welcome :)
