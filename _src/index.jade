    # The DjVu.js Viewer demo
    DjVu.js is a program library for working with `.djvu` files online.
    It's written in JavaScript and can be run in a web browser without any connection with the server.
    It's absolutely open source and you can see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/RussCoder/djvujs)
    Also there is the DjVu.js Viewer, which allows you to view .djvu files online right in the browser.
    It's written in ReactJS and powered with DjVu.js library.

    **Note, you can expand the app to full page via a click on ![expand](/img/expand.svg) at the right bottom corner.**

    Here you can see the Viewer and try it out. If you don't have a djvu file you may view the examples - just click on one of the following links.
